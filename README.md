# React Learning Project

## Learning Goal

The goal of this project is to dive deep into React and its ecosystem, including various features, hooks, and associated libraries. Through this project, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of React and its best practices, enabling me to build robust and scalable web applications.

## Approach

I will be using Create React App to set up the initial project structure. Each project within this repository will focus on different aspects of React, such as components, state management, routing, and styling. I will also explore advanced concepts like hooks, context API, and integrating Redux for state management.
